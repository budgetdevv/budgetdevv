### I'm TrumpMcDonaldz, a student developer! 👋

I enjoy writing performant algorithms, and studying low-level quirks / optimization techniques! 

My main choice of language is C#. Recent runtimes ( .NET 5+ ) expose low-level hardware intrinsics that enable us to write high-performance code! 

My goal is to eventually become good at low-level topics, since help is very limited in this area. People skilled in their craft are often arrogant / condescending, hence I strive to become good enough to offer help to others!

__**Tools I Use**__

• JetBrains Rider ( Running .NET 7 SDK )

• Git BASH ( And consequentially Git )

__**Interests**__

• Performance optimization

• Pretty much most things low-level

• Looking to explore machine learning

__**Credits**__

• Norbo for making BepuPhysics, my main source of inspiration

• Ximvu, Phrosty, JDPhenix for their past guidance
