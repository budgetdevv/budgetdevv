### I'm TrumpMcDonaldz, a dev by hobby! ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy writing performant algorithms, and studying low-level quirks / optimization techniques! 

My main choice of language is C#. Recent runtimes ( .NET 5+ ) expose low-level hardware intrinsics that enable us to write high-performance code! 

My goal is to eventually become good at low-level topics, since help is very limited in this area. People skilled in their craft are often arrogant / condescending, hence I strive to become good enough to offer help to others!

__**Tools I Use**__

â€¢ JetBrains Rider ( Running .NET 7 SDK )

â€¢ Git BASH ( And consequentially Git )

__**Interests**__

â€¢ Performance optimization

â€¢ Pretty much most things low-level

â€¢ Experimenting a little with machine learning as of recent

__**Credits**__

â€¢ Norbo for making BepuPhysics, my main source of inspiration

â€¢ Ximvu, Phrosty, JDPhenix for their past guidance
