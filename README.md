### I'm TrumpMcDonaldz, a student developer! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a year 1 student in Temasek Polytechnic, pursuing a diploma in Information Technology!

My main choice of language is C#, as its modern runtime support various hardware intrinsics used in high-performance code ( Including new AVX512 ones ). Good async support as well.

I have a keen interest in data structures and algorithms, performance optimization and most things low-level.

I have also worked with Python ( Tkinter module in school ) and Objective C ( Mainly to call into C-side APIs not available via Xamarin.Mac, for my MacTweaks project ).

__**Tools I Use**__

â€¢ JetBrains Rider ( Running .NET 7 SDK )

â€¢ GIT version control system

__**Interests**__

â€¢ Performance optimization

â€¢ Pretty much most things low-level

â€¢ Problem solving is my passion. I enjoy finding creative and original solutions to challenging situations, especially when there are no existing resources to guide me. Problem solving enhances my critical thinking and analytical skills, and allows me to view problems from different perspectives.

â€¢ Looking to explore machine learning

__**People who have helped / inspired me**__

â€¢ Norbo for making BepuPhysics2, my main source of inspiration

â€¢ Ximvu, Phrosty, JDPhenix for their past guidance

__**Socials**__

â€¢ Discord @trumpmcdonaldz
