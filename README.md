### I'm TrumpMcDonaldz, a student developer! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a year 1 student in Temasek Polytechnic, pursuing a diploma in Information Technology!

My main choice of language is C#, as its modern runtime support various hardware intrinsics used in high-performance code ( Including new AVX512 ones ). Good async support as well.

I have a keen interest in data structures and algorithms, performance optimization and most things low-level.

__**Other languages I've worked with**__

â€¢ Java

â€¢ Python

â€¢ Javascript / TypeScript

â€¢ C / Objective-C

â€¢ x86-64 Assembly

__**Development Tools**__

â€¢ JetBrains IDES ( Rider, PyCharm, WebStorm, CLion )

â€¢ GIT version control system

â€¢ DBeaver / MySQLWorkbench

__**Interests**__

â€¢ Performance optimization

â€¢ Pretty much most things low-level

â€¢ Problem solving is my passion. I enjoy finding creative and original solutions to challenging situations, especially when there are no existing resources to guide me.

â€¢ Exploring machine learning ( PyTorch, TorchSharp and ML.NET )

__**People who have helped / inspired me**__

â€¢ Norbo for making BepuPhysics2. It sparked my interest in performance optimization / low-level programming.

â€¢ Ximvu, Phrosty, JDPhenix for being such a great help when I was first embarking on my programming journey.

__**Socials**__

â€¢ Discord @trumpmcdonaldz
